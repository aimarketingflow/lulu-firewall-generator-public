## üõ°Ô∏è LuLu Firewall Setup

### Step 1: Install LuLu

1. Download LuLu from Objective-See
2. Open the DMG file
3. Drag LuLu to Applications
4. Launch LuLu
5. Grant necessary permissions when prompted

### Step 2: Configure LuLu Settings

Click the LuLu menu bar icon ‚Üí **Settings**

#### Rules Tab Settings

```
‚úì Allow Installed Programs (checked)
‚úó Allow Apple Programs (UNCHECKED - we'll add specific ones)
‚úó Allow DNS Traffic (UNCHECKED - more secure)
‚úó Allow Simulator Applications (unchecked unless needed)
```

**Why uncheck "Allow Apple Programs"?**
- Many Apple processes phone home unnecessarily
- Telemetry, analytics, crash reports
- We'll manually allow only what you need

#### Mode Tab Settings

**Choose: Passive Mode**

```
New connections should be: BLOCKED
Rules for new connections should be created? YES
```

**What this means:**
- LuLu runs silently in the background
- All new connections are blocked by default
- You'll be prompted to allow/block each new connection
- Rules are saved automatically

**Alternative: Block Mode** (Advanced)
- Blocks EVERYTHING unless explicitly allowed
- More secure but requires pre-configured rules
- Use after you've built your ruleset

### Step 3: Initial Setup Complete

‚úÖ LuLu is now running in Passive Mode
‚úÖ All new connections will be blocked
‚úÖ You'll be prompted for each app

---

## üö´ Recommended Block Rules

These Apple processes should be **BLOCKED** for maximum privacy:

### Telemetry & Analytics

1. **adprivacyd** - Ad privacy daemon
   - `com.apple.ap.adprivacyd`
   - Block: `any address:any port`

2. **analyticsd** - Analytics collection
   - `com.apple.analyticsd`
   - Block: `any address:any port`

3. **diagnosticd** - Diagnostic reporting
   - `com.apple.diagnosticd`
   - Block: `any address:any port`

### Cloud Services (Block if not using iCloud)

## üìä Activity Monitor as Network Monitor

Activity Monitor is a free, built-in alternative to Wireshark for basic network monitoring.

### Step 1: Open Activity Monitor

```bash
# Via Spotlight
Cmd + Space ‚Üí "Activity Monitor"

# Or via Terminal
open -a "Activity Monitor"
```

### Step 2: View Network Activity

1. Click the **Network** tab at the top
2. You'll see:
   - **Packets In/Out** - Total network traffic
   - **Data Received/Sent** - Bandwidth usage per process

### Step 3: Sort by Network Usage

1. Click **Sent Bytes** column header
2. Processes using the most bandwidth appear at top
3. Look for suspicious activity:
   - Unknown processes
   - High bandwidth from system processes
   - Apps that shouldn't be online

### Step 4: Identify Suspicious Connections

**Red Flags:**
- ‚ùå System processes sending large amounts of data
- ‚ùå Apps you're not using showing network activity
- ‚ùå Unknown process names
- ‚ùå Processes connecting when you're "offline"

**Example Suspicious Activity:**
```
Process: trustd
Sent Bytes: 50 MB
Received Bytes: 10 MB
‚Üí Why is a certificate daemon sending 50MB?
```

### Step 5: Get Detailed Connection Info

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
# See all active connections
lsof -i -n -P

# See connections for a specific process
lsof -i -n -P | grep "process-name"

# Example: Check what Safari is connecting to
lsof -i -n -P | grep Safari
```

**Output Example:**
```
Safari    1234 user   42u  IPv4 0x123abc  TCP 192.168.1.5:54321->17.253.144.10:443 (ESTABLISHED)
```

This shows:
- Safari (PID 1234)
- Connected to 17.253.144.10:443 (Apple server)
- Connection is established

---

## ‚ûï Adding Rules Based on Activity Monitor

### Scenario: You see suspicious activity in Activity Monitor

**Example:** You notice `trustd` is sending data to `17.253.144.10:443`

### Step-by-Step: Create a Block Rule

#### 1. Identify the Process

In Activity Monitor:
- Note the process name: `trustd`
- Note it's sending data

#### 2. Get Connection Details

In Terminal:
```bash
lsof -i -n -P | grep trustd
```

Output:
```
trustd  567  root   8u  IPv4  TCP *:*->17.253.144.10:443 (ESTABLISHED)
```

You now know:
- Process: `trustd`
- Destination: `17.253.144.10`
- Port: `443`

#### 3. Find Process Path

```bash
ps aux | grep trustd
```

Output shows path:
```
/usr/libexec/trustd
```

#### 4. Create LuLu Rule

1. Open LuLu ‚Üí **Rules**
2. Click **Add Rule** (+ button at bottom right)
3. Fill in the form:

```
Process Path: /usr/libexec/trustd
Endpoint Address: 17.253.144.10
Endpoint Port: 443
Action: BLOCK (red X icon)
```

4. Click **Add**

#### 5. Verify Rule is Active

1. In LuLu Rules window
2. Find `trustd` in the list
3. Should show: `17.253.144.10:443` ‚Üí **Block**

#### 6. Test the Block

1. Watch Activity Monitor
2. `trustd` should show 0 bytes sent
3. If still sending, check rule is correct

### Alternative: Block All Connections for a Process

If you want to block ALL connections (not just one IP):

```
Process Path: /usr/libexec/trustd
Endpoint Address: * (wildcard)
Endpoint Port: * (wildcard)
Action: BLOCK
```

This blocks `trustd` from connecting to ANY destination.

## üö´ Apple ID Security Considerations

### Why Not Using an Apple ID Improves Security

**Exploits Prevented:**
1. **iCloud Sync Exploits** - No cloud data to compromise
2. **Keychain Sync Attacks** - Passwords stay local only
3. **Find My Mac Tracking** - Can't be tracked remotely
4. **Remote Wipe Attacks** - Can't be remotely wiped
5. **Account Takeover** - No Apple account to hijack
6. **Two-Factor Bypass** - No 2FA to bypass
7. **Phishing Attacks** - No Apple ID to phish

**Services You Lose:**
- ‚ùå iCloud Drive
- ‚ùå iCloud Photos
- ‚ùå iCloud Keychain
- ‚ùå Find My Mac
- ‚ùå Handoff/Continuity
- ‚ùå App Store purchases (can still download free apps)
- ‚ùå iMessage (on Mac)
- ‚ùå FaceTime (on Mac)

### How to Use macOS Without Apple ID

#### 1. During Setup

When setting up a new Mac:
1. Skip the Apple ID login screen
2. Click "Set Up Later" or "Skip"
3. Continue with local account only

#### 2. On Existing Mac

To sign out:
1. System Settings ‚Üí Apple ID
2. Click "Sign Out"
3. Choose to keep or delete local copies of iCloud data
4. Confirm sign out

#### 3. Alternative Services

Replace iCloud services:
- **Cloud Storage**: Dropbox, Google Drive, Nextcloud (self-hosted)
- **Password Manager**: 1Password, Bitwarden, KeePassXC (local)
- **Photos**: Local storage + external backup
- **Messaging**: Signal, Telegram, WhatsApp
- **Video Calls**: Zoom, Google Meet, Signal

### Processes to Block When Not Using Apple ID

```
‚úì cloudd - iCloud daemon
‚úì cloudpaird - iCloud pairing  
‚úì iCloudDrive - iCloud Drive sync
‚úì bird - iCloud sync
‚úì CloudPhotosConfiguration - iCloud Photos

## üî• Advanced: LuLu + Murus Combined

For maximum security, use both LuLu and Murus together.

### Why Use Both?

**LuLu (Application Firewall)**
- Controls which apps can connect
- Blocks at application level
- Easy to use
- Free

**Murus (Network Firewall)**
- Controls network traffic by IP/port
- Blocks at network level
- Advanced packet filtering
- Paid (~$20)

**Together:**
- Double layer of protection
- LuLu blocks apps
- Murus blocks network traffic
- Even if an app bypasses LuLu, Murus catches it

### Setup: LuLu + Murus

#### 1. Install Both

- LuLu: https://objective-see.org/products/lulu.html
- Murus: https://www.murusfirewall.com

#### 2. Configure LuLu (Application Layer)

Use our tool to generate app-specific rules:
```bash
python3 create_app_specific_rules.py
```

Import rules into LuLu.

#### 3. Configure Murus (Network Layer)

In Murus:
1. **Inbound Rules**: Block all by default
2. **Outbound Rules**: Allow only specific ports
   - Port 443 (HTTPS)
   - Port 80 (HTTP)
   - Port 53 (DNS) - if needed
   - Port 587 (SMTP) - for email
   - Port 993 (IMAP) - for email

3. **Block Lists**: Enable
   - Malware IPs
   - Tracking domains
   - Ad networks

#### 4. Test Both Firewalls

```bash
# Test outbound connection
curl https://google.com

# Should be blocked by either LuLu or Murus
# Allow in both if needed
```

### Rule Priority

```
1. Murus blocks at network level (first)
2. If Murus allows, LuLu checks at app level (second)
3. If both allow, connection succeeds
```
