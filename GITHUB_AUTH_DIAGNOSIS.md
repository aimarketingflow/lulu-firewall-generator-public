# GitHub Authentication Diagnosis

## Current Situation

Your original rules already have:
- ✅ Windsurf Main: ALLOW `*:*` (action=0)
- ✅ Electron Helper: ALLOW `*:*` (action=0)  
- ✅ language_server: ALLOW `*:*` (action=0)
- ❌ Windsurf Helper: BLOCK `*:*` (action=1)

**So 3 out of 4 components can already connect anywhere!**

## Why GitHub Auth Still Fails

The error "Unable to get the currently logged in user, GitHub Pull Requests will not work correctly" suggests:

### Option 1: It's NOT a firewall issue
- GitHub auth might be failing for other reasons:
  - Expired token
  - GitHub API rate limit
  - Extension bug
  - Credentials not synced

### Option 2: Windsurf Helper needs network
- The one blocked component (Windsurf Helper) might be the one doing GitHub auth
- Solution: Allow Windsurf Helper too

### Option 3: Specific API endpoint
- Maybe it needs a specific GitHub API endpoint not covered by wildcards
- Example: `api.github.com/user` vs `github.com/login/oauth`

## Recommended Test

### Test 1: Allow Windsurf Helper
Since it's the only blocked component, try allowing it:

```json
"com.exafunction.windsurf.helper": [
  {
    "action": "0",  // ALLOW
    "endpointAddr": "*",
    "endpointPort": "*"
  }
]
```

### Test 2: Check if it's not a firewall issue
1. Start Windsurf with current (permissive) rules
2. If GitHub auth still fails, it's NOT a firewall issue
3. Try these VSCode commands:
   ```
   > GitHub: Sign Out
   > GitHub: Sign In
   ```

### Test 3: Check LuLu logs during auth
```bash
# Clear logs
sudo rm /Library/Logs/LuLu.log

# Start monitoring
tail -f /Library/Logs/LuLu.log | grep -E "github|BLOCK"

# Then try GitHub auth in Windsurf
```

## Quick Fix to Test

Since your original rules are already very permissive (3/4 ALLOW all), let's just:
1. Keep those permissive rules
2. Add specific GitHub endpoints to Windsurf Helper only
3. Test if that fixes it

If it STILL doesn't work with 3 components having full network access, then **it's definitely not a firewall issue** - it's a GitHub/VSCode auth problem.
