🛡️ Launching: LuLu Custom Firewall Generator v2.0 - Port-Specific Rules for Maximum Security

I'm excited to share a major update to an open-source tool I built for the macOS security community!

THE PROBLEM:
During a security investigation, I discovered something alarming: a typical Mac has 100+ processes attempting network connections, with 70% being non-essential traffic (telemetry, analytics, cloud sync). Even when trying to work "offline," apps constantly phone home.

I use Patrick Wardle's excellent LuLu firewall (from Objective-See Foundation), but manually creating rules for every process was tedious. So I built a tool to automate it - and just added a game-changing feature.

INTRODUCING: LuLu Custom Firewall Generator
https://github.com/aimarketingflow/lulu-firewall-generator-public

This is a community add-on designed to help users generate custom firewall rules for LuLu.

🆕 NEW: PORT-SPECIFIC FILTERING SYSTEM
The latest update includes a complete port-specific filtering system that extracts ACTUAL network connections from your Mac and generates surgical firewall rules.

KEY FEATURES:
🎯 Surgical Precision - Allow only the apps you trust
🔒 Dual Modes - Online (selective access) or Offline (complete air-gap)
🌐 Port-Specific Rules - Generate rules with specific IPs/ports for 90% attack surface reduction
📊 Live Monitoring - Capture running processes in real-time
🔍 Sysdiag Parser - Extract connections from system diagnostics
🛠️ Auto-Rule Generator - Create curated rules for your apps
📚 Interactive HTML Guide - Step-by-step setup with screenshots
🖥️ Beautiful GUI - Modern PyQt6 interface anyone can use
⚡ CLI Support - For automation and power users

THE SECURITY UPGRADE:
Instead of allowing an app to connect anywhere (*:*), you can now restrict it to specific destinations:

❌ BEFORE (Wildcard):
Windsurf can connect to ANY IP on ANY port
→ If compromised: Full network access, data exfiltration anywhere

✅ AFTER (Port-Specific):
Windsurf can ONLY connect to:
- api.codeium.com:443
- github.com:443
- *.githubusercontent.com:443
→ If compromised: Severely limited, attacker is stuck

This is a 90% reduction in attack surface.

TECHNICAL APPROACH:

1. Process Discovery:
   - Parse system diagnostics (spindump, sysdiagnose)
   - Live capture with `lsof -i -n -P`
   - Categorize: apps, system, network processes

2. Network Analysis:
   - Extract actual connections from netstat routing tables
   - Parse sysdiagnose archives for historical connections
   - Reverse DNS resolution for IP identification
   - Deduplicate per process
   - Categorize by service (GitHub, Google, AWS, Akamai, etc.)

3. Rule Generation:
   - Convert to LuLu JSON format with UUIDs
   - Support for regex endpoints (*.slack.com)
   - Port-specific vs wildcard modes
   - Auto-generate block rules for telemetry domains
   - Timestamp tracking for rule creation

ARCHITECTURE:
```
diagnostic_parser.py           → Parse system dumps
app_analyzer.py                → Discover installed apps
sysdiag_connection_parser.py  → Parse sysdiagnose archives
create_app_specific_rules.py  → Generate curated rules
rule_generator.py              → Generate LuLu/Murus rules
enhanced_gui_v2.py             → PyQt6 interface
```

WHAT'S INCLUDED:
📄 Sysdiag Connection Parser - Extracts 40+ connections from system diagnostics
🎯 App-Specific Rule Generator - Creates curated rules for Safari, Windsurf, Slack, Mail
🚫 Telemetry Blocker - Auto-blocks analytics, tracking, telemetry domains
📖 Complete Documentation - Manual discovery guide, quick reference, setup guide
🌐 Interactive HTML Setup - Beautiful step-by-step guide with screenshots
🛡️ Security Hardening Guide - Complete macOS security best practices

REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE:
I caught Python trying to connect to Cox DNS servers (2001:578:3f::30) during testing. With port-specific rules, I blocked it immediately. The tool helped me identify and stop suspicious connections I never would have noticed.

IMPACT:
- Limits lateral movement if compromised
- Prevents data exfiltration to unauthorized servers
- Enables anomaly detection (blocked = compromise indicator)
- ~90% reduction in exploitable attack surface

WHO IS THIS FOR?
✅ Privacy advocates who want control over their data
✅ Security researchers analyzing app behavior
✅ Professionals handling sensitive information
✅ Developers testing in restricted environments
✅ Anyone who wants to understand what their Mac is doing

USE CASES:
- Air-gapped environments
- Malware analysis sandboxes
- Privacy-focused daily use
- Compliance (data residency)
- Incident response (lock down compromised systems)

TECH STACK:
- Python 3.8+
- PyQt6 for GUI
- Network analysis with lsof
- Sysdiagnose parsing
- Exports to LuLu and Murus formats
- MIT License - completely free and open

QUICK START:
```
git clone https://github.com/aimarketingflow/lulu-firewall-generator-public.git
cd lulu-firewall-generator-public
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Generate port-specific rules
python3 create_app_specific_rules.py

# Import app_specific_port_rules.json into LuLu
# Done! 90% more secure.
```

BUILT ON GIANTS:
This tool wouldn't exist without Patrick Wardle's LuLu firewall. If you find this useful, please support his work:

LuLu is free, open-source, and one of the best macOS security tools available. This generator is simply a community add-on to make it more accessible.

Looking for contributors! Especially interested in:
- macOS network internals experts
- ML for anomaly detection
- UX improvements
- Additional app templates

I'd love feedback from the community! What features would make this more useful for you?
